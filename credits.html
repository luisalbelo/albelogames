            <p class="TextAbout">HI, I'm Luis Albelo Sanchez, and indie game developer.<br><br>My passion is reading 
                the bible-but not only as a religious text. I see in God's world more than just commands for living 
                a straight life; I see the love of God revealed in every form, both big and small. I see His love in 
                his son Jesus, our Savior, and I wish that you could see that too.<br><br>God has given me talents, and 
                I want to use them for you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to show you what the Lord has 
                gifted me. I give it to you in the form of a game.
